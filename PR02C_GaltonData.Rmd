## Setup

### Packages Used

```{r loadpackages}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Datasets Used

#### Background of the Data

Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, studied the relationship between parent heights and the heights of their offspring. His pioneering [1886 article](https://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1886-jaigi-regression-stature.pdf) is the first appearance of regression analysis in print. He originated many statistical terms and concepts, including regression, correlation, deviate, quartile, and percentile, plus median for the midpoint of a distribution. The `galtonheightdata` dataset was [created under the direction of Dr. James A. Hanley](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/) using Galton's [original paper notebooks](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/notebook/index.html) containing the measurement data. You can access the `galtonfamiliesmain.csv` and `galtonfamiliessub.csv` datasets from the [description](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/InstructorDescriptions/galtonheightdata.html) page. A third dataset, `galtonfamiliesnotebook.csv`, shows the notebook page on which each family's information was recorded.

#### Galton Main Dataset

```{r loadmaindata}
library(tidyverse)
main <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonfamiliesmain.csv")
glimpse(main)
```

#### Galton Subset Dataset

```{r loadsubdata}
library(tidyverse)
sub <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonfamiliessub.csv")
glimpse(sub)
```

#### Galton Notebook Dataset

```{r loadnotebook}
library(tidyverse)
notebook <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonfamiliesnotebook.csv")
glimpse(notebook)
```

## Analyses

### Create the Analysis Datasets

#### Dataset #1

Load the three Galton datasets and use `glimpse()` to explore their structures. Refer to Project 1 and use the new data binding/joining skills you have learned to assemble a single dataset that meets the following criteria. Use `glimpse()` and `head()` to display the result. (Hint: Use `bind_rows()` to connect the `main` and `sub` datasets, then use a join to add the `notebook` information.)

* contains these variables:
   * `familyid` = ID number of the family, with `136A` recoded as `205`
   * `page` = the notebook page on which the family is recorded
   * `num_children`= the number of children in the family
   * `father_ht` = the height of the father
   * `mother_ht` = the "transmuted" (per Galton) height of the mother
   * `midparent` = the average of the parents' heights (using transmuted mother)
   * `child_sex`= whether the child is a son or a daughter, in all lower case
   * `child_ht` = the height of the child with daughter heights "transmuted"
   
* is arranged according to:
   * ascending order of familyid
   * sons before daughters within family
   * in order of height within each sex of child

```{r assembledata1}
assembleddata1 <- main %>%
   mutate(
      familyID = as.numeric(ifelse(FamilyID == "136A", 205, FamilyID)))
    select(
       familyID,
       page = notebook,
       num_children = Children,
       father_ht = Father,
       mother_ht = MotherT,
       midparent,
       child_sex,
       child_ht
    )
glimpse(assembledata1)
```

#### Dataset #2

From Dataset #1, select the variables `familyid` and `num_children`, then reduce the dataset so it contains only one unique row per family. Use `glimpse()` to display the result. (Hint: The final dataset should have 205 rows/observations and two variables/columns.)

```{r assembledata2}
assembledata2 <- 
   
   select(familyID,
          num_children)
glimpse(assembleddata2)
```

### Visualization 1: Updated Scatterplot

#### Galton's Visualization

In his original paper (linked above), Galton created several tables and diagrams. His "Diagram Based on Table 1" of them is similar in concept to a scatterplot. Rather than dots, he grouped/tabulated the data, and then used the count of how many people were grouped at the coordinate pairs in his grid, with child as the x-axis and mid-parent as the y-axis. There are two scales: inches and deviations from 68.25 inches.

```{r galtonscatterplot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../images/galtonplot.png")
```

#### Your Data Visualization

**This plot uses Dataset #1.**

Create a scatterplot of child height (x-axis) versus mid-parent height (y-axis). Ordinarily, we might reverse the axes here because analysts would be more likely to model child height as a function of parent height, but we want to be able to compare the updated plot to Galton's original.

Include the following.

* make your dots larger than the default size to help show density
* set transparency to adjust for overplotting and help show density
* use `color =` in the `aes` to differentiate sons versus daughters
* use `scale_color_manual()` to choose two colorblind-safe colors
* scale both axes so that there is a tick mark at every whole inch
* use `coord_fixed()` so that the axes have the same unit spacing
* add better x- and y-axis labels, including the units of measure
* add an informative title (you may optionally include a subtitle)
* add `color =` to `labs()` to set the legend title to `"gender of child"` 
* use a built-in theme (e.g., `theme_linedraw()`) to add formatting
* use `theme()` to move the legend to the bottom of the scatterplot

```{r updatedscatterplot}
geom_scatter()
```

### Visualization 2: Number of Children

**This plot uses Dataset #2.**

Create a barplot to show the distribution of the number of children per family. Set the bars to something other than the default `width`. Scale the x-axis so that there is a tick mark for each bar. Choose appropriate colors, labels, themes, and/or and other types of formatting that you feel will enhance the meaning or visual appearance of the plot.  (Hint: Use `count()` to find out how many families have a given number of children, then use that information to create your plot.)

```{r childrenbarplot}
geom_bar()
```
